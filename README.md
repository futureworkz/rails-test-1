# Jokes Single Serving Website

## Requirements
This app will display a single joke for the user to read.  
After reading the joke, the user will like or dislike the joke.  
The app will record the vote in database and then show another joke for the user to read.  
When there is no more jokes to show, the app will display a `"That's all the jokes for today! Come back another day!"` message.
